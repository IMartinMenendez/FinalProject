- How it works:
  - [x] Create an Account.
  - [x] Looking for events you wanted to attend.
  - [x] Don't find what are your looking for? Create your own and give the chance to other users to attend to it.
  - [x] Change the world.

##  üöÄ&nbsp; Installation and Documentation 

Please note, this project has 4 Microservices and an Edge connecting all of them. You will need tot have all up and running with Eureka to make this project work.
You will need to clone the project or download it as a zip from the [Final Project Repository](https://github.com/IMartinMenendez/FinalProject.git). Also, you will need to clone the front end repository to visualize the web. Do it on [Final Project Front End Repository](https://github.com/IMartinMenendez/FinalProjectFront.git) 
After that, you will need to replicate the database.
You can find the database structure Table.SQL file named [SQL Structure](https://github.com/IMartinMenendez/FinalProject/blob/master/sql.sql). Just copy and create them.
Also, you will need to set up the project and link it with the database. Please add the details on application.properties under the folder resources.
This set up will be very similar to this:

```
spring.flyway.enabled=false

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://yourdatabaseurl
spring.datasource.username=yourUserName
spring.datasource.password=yourPassword
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate

spring.jpa.show-sql=true

server.error.include-message=always
server.error.include-binding-errors=always

spring.jackson.serialization.write-dates-as-timestamps=false
```

You will need to do it also to test the application.

## ‚úèÔ∏è&nbsp; Microservices

### Events

All related with Events, where they are saved and displayed
### Course

Similar Microservice to the Events. We will keep and display all courses with this Microservice.

### Users

Taking care of all security, login and logout methods and checking token to make sure the user is right to change, delete or create an event.

### Notifications

This Microservice use Kafka to display notifications to all users attending to an event, if this event is modified or deleted.
We want to make sure you don't miss anything.

### Edge

It will call all other events and will be the only contact from the front end.
